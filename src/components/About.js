      <p style={{textAlign:"left",padding:"10px",paddingTop:"0px",marginTop:'-5px',paddingBottom:"20px"}}>Suppose you planned for a trip and made a budget of 'X' amount, at the end of the trip you got to know that the expenditure cost 'Y' amount.
      Now you are trying to remember that where have you paid extra, out of the budget. It's hard to remember right!<br/> <br/> 
      Inorder to track all those expenses an invoice card for every transaction can be created with the specified date. Therefore, I made this project from the learnings of MERN stack development. For me this web application is an learning based project made from scratch.
